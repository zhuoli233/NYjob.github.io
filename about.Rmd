##What challenge did we meet?

1. The first challenge we met is when we first time drew the location map by changing address into longitude and latitude. Since Google map has time limits for one day, it took us long time to get and modify data. In view of taking too much time when using shiny, we decided to write a new csv of the data set containing the longitude and latitude information. After that, the app went faster using the new data.  
  
2. Since word cloud is fantastic and prettier than word count, we choose to make word cloud in our website. However, it took about ten minutes to show the word clouds in dashboard every time. We tried several ways, but we haven't found an effective way to show a beautiful word cloud as the original one.
