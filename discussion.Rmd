##Discussion
There are more job positions located at prosperous places and downtown. It makes sense that companies and departments always located in downtown.  
We found that for base salary of jobs required for at least master degree, engineering has the highest median base salary, for base salary of jobs required for baccalaureate degree, technology has the highest median base salary, and for base salary without requirement of degree, the median base salary and the overall base salary of Engineering are all pretty high compared with other job categories.   
From 2013 to 2017, the number of job positions in each category keeps increasing. And in 2017, all categories have a dramatic increase in job positions. This might be because there are more positions needed in government during the recent year.  Engineering positions have greatest increasing between 2016 to 2017, and job in health has greatly increased between 2015 to 2016. We may predict that there will be greatly needed for talents in health and engineering area. While jobs in maintenance have decreased between 2013 to 2014. Maybe this is because of the development of technology, fewer manpower is needed for maintenance.  
"Experience" is the top popular word in both preferred skills and requirements. It is important for people who want a job to get prepared. We may do some internship or related project to make us more competitive. Other top words in preferred skills are "written","project" and "team" . Employers always preferred candidates with strong skills especially written skills and team work.In requirements, "school" appears frequently. We may infer that educational background is also important. Also, there exists a linear regression between base salary and civil service title level, higher salary could be gained with a higher level started. 
There are still some limitation of the analysis. Since the restrict of the source of data, we only analysised the information of job in New York government. So, for more generalized result, the analysis of the job information in companies may be needed. Also, the data all comes from the recuiment informaton, which may be different from the real status after becomed an employee. So, further research may need to consider those limitaions.


##Suggestion
1. High educational background can have a high base salary in engineering and technology.  Also these two job categories have the highest average salary. If you are interested in these areas, high degree is necessary.   
2. The number of positions is increasing during these years, especially in health and engineering area. You will have more opportunity in these areas.   
3. Most jobs preferred experience and strong written ability. It is important to develop written skills and build more related experience.
